# latex-environment
This repository contains some LaTeX configuration files and the texmf tree.

By setting the environmental variable `TEXMFHOME` to the path of the [`texmf`](texmf/) directory, any custom packages located within it can be loaded.
Feel free to customize the configuration files and to add packages to suit your needs.

It is recommended to install this using [ubuntu-environment](https://github.com/conjikidow/ubuntu-environment.git).
